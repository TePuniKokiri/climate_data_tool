<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The primary objective of this study and its accompanying data tool is
to assess the resilience of Māori communities in response to climate
change. Climate change is attributed to both natural factors and changes
resulting from human behaviour, leading to climate hazards such as sea
level rise and extreme heat events. These hazards are projected to
escalate in the future, and communities face varying degrees of exposure
depending on their geographical location. The risk of adverse impacts
arises from both climate-related hazards and the vulnerability and
exposure of communities. Our research focuses on the interaction between
these two factors, depicted as the white intersection area in the middle
of the schematic, where we investigate the exposure of Māori communities
to projected climate hazards in relation to their current socio-economic
circumstances.</p>

Figure 19-1 in Emergent Risks and Key Vulnerabilities (Impacts,
Adaptation, and Vulnerability. Part A, p. 1039-1099), by Oppenheimer et
al., 2014, Cambridge University Press, has served as the methodological
framework for this project. In this initial exploratory phase, we do not
consider adaptation and mitigation actions/plans, governance, or changes
in community resilience over time.

<h3>Climate Hazards</h3>
<p>We focused on climate hazards projected to have the most substantial
and immediate impact on human lives based on the identification of
significant risks to human wellbeing outlined in the 2020 National
Climate Change Risk Assessment
<a href=https://environment.govt.nz/publications/national-climate-change-risk-assessment-for-new-zealand-main-report/ target="_blank">report</a>
published by the Ministry for the Environment (MfE). These hazards
include floods, sea level rise, and changes in the frequency of
heatwaves, extreme hot days, wet spells, extreme rainfall, and droughts.
The climate hazard information is based on datasets provided by the
National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research
<a href=https://niwa.co.nz/ target="_blank">(NIWA)</a>. We obtained
climate datasets for both a baseline period from 1986 to 2005 and
projected changes averaged over the period from 2031 to 2050
(mid-century). Except for the flood data, all the climate indicators
presented in this tool are based on mid-century projections. These
projections are mostly based on a low-moderate global emission
trajectory called Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 (RCP 4.5),
developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and
used in global climate models.</p>
<p>For this study, we have aggregated climate data to the 2022
Statistical Area (SA2) geographical divisions. The SA2 geography,
typically inhabited by 1,000 to 4,000 residents, is designed to reflect
communities that interact socially and economically. We opted for SA2
over a smaller geographic area to ensure that a comprehensive set of
descriptive characteristics about households and communities can be
derived from the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI).</p>
<p>The majority of climate data, excluding sea level rise, was provided
in the form of spatial grid (raster) files. To transform this data to
the SA2 level, we extracted the maximum value of each climate variable
within the SA2 area. Sea level rise data was supplied as shapefiles,
which we overlaid with SA2s and summarised to calculate the area of
overlap per layer. It is important to note that the climate data does
not fully cover all the SA2s. For our exploratory analysis, we imputed
climate data for these missing areas (except for the Chatham Islands) by
referencing the nearest SA2 area with non-missing climate data.</p>
<p>The climate indicators used in this study are briefly discussed
below.</p>

<img src="img/floods.svg" style="margin-right:10px;" alt="Floods"/>
Floods
</h4>
<p>Flooding has significant direct and indirect impacts on people’s
health and wellbeing. Floods can cause extensive physical damage to
employment sites, personal property, and critical infrastructure,
including homes, roads, and utilities. Our research focused on examining
areas prone to flooding by using composite flood hazard area maps
provided by regional and district councils to NIWA. These maps were
created from modelled and historic flood hazard maps and flood-prone
soil maps, publicly available in August 2018. There are no future
projections available at this stage, although work is underway to
produce these in the next couple of years. The flood data in this tool
is represented as a percentage of an area that is either known or
potentially flood-prone land. The data is organised into twenty levels,
each spanning a 5% width. The pivot table presents flood information in
levels with a width of 10%. In some cases, categories with lower counts
may have been combined in the maps or tables.</p>
<h4 style="color:#007c9d;">
<img src="img/wet_spells.svg" style="margin-right:10px;" alt="Wet Spells"/>
Wet Spells
</h4>
<p>In this work, a wet spell is defined as a period of five consecutive
days during which the total daily rainfall exceeds 1 mm. The wet spells
can have both direct and indirect adverse health effects, such as
increased mould growth in housing due to prolonged dampness,
contamination of drinking water sources, and reduced mental health
stemming from decreased exposure to sunlight. The wet spell data in this
tool is represented by the number of days per year that fall within a
wet spell - defined as previously described. The data is categorised
into levels with a width of twenty days. In some cases, categories with
lower counts may have been combined in the maps or tables.</p>
<h4 style="color:#007c9d;">
<img src="img/rainfall.svg" style="margin-right:10px;" alt="Extreme Rainfall"/>
Extreme Rainfall
</h4>
<p>Extreme rainfall is expected to rise as a result of climate change,
driven by the capacity of a warmer atmosphere to retain greater
moisture. These intense rain events are often linked to storms and can
significantly impact people and communities by causing hazards such as
flooding, landslides, and damage to buildings and infrastructure. In
this tool, extreme rainfall is defined as the number of days per year
when rainfall exceeds 30 mm in a day. The indicator is categorised into
five-day bins in the pivot table, and ten-day bins in the maps and
location insights. Some categories may have been merged due to low
counts.</p>

Heatwave
</h4>
<p>A heatwave is characterised by sustained and significantly higher
temperatures than the usual climate values of a specific location.
Global warming has contributed to the increased frequency and intensity
of heatwaves worldwide. Heatwaves often occur alongside other climate
hazards, such as droughts and wildfires. The impacts of heatwaves
encompass social, environmental, and economic dimensions, including
surge in heat-related deaths, pressure on water and energy resources,
and challenges to food and livelihood security. In this study, a
heatwave is defined as a period of three consecutive days (or more)
during which the temperature exceeds 25 degrees Celsius. The heatwave
data is categorised into five-day bins in the maps and location
insights, and ten-day bins in the pivot table. Note that categories with
lower counts may have been combined in the maps or tables.</p>

<img src="img/hot_days.svg" style="margin-right:10px;" alt="Extreme Hot Days"/>
Extreme Hot Days
</h4>
<p>Extreme hot days can significantly impact human health; prolonged
exposure to high temperatures can lead to heat-related illnesses,
exacerbate existing conditions, and increase the mortality rate.
Vulnerable groups, including the elderly, infants, outdoor workers, and
those in poverty, are particularly susceptible. Additionally, heatwaves
strain health services, disrupt infrastructure, and reduce productivity.
In this context, extreme hot days refers to the number of days per year
where the daily maximum temperature exceeds 30 degrees Celsius. This
indicator is categorised into one-day bins in the maps and location
insights, and two-day bins in the pivot table. Lower count levels may
have been merged.</p>
<h4 style="color:#007c9d;">
<img src="img/droughts.svg" style="margin-right:10px;" alt="Droughts"/>
Droughts
</h4>
<p>Droughts occur due to inadequate precipitation over an extended
period, resulting in soil dryness and reduced water levels in rivers,
streams, lakes, and dams. The impacts of droughts encompass economic,
environmental, and social dimensions. Specifically, droughts severely
affect agriculture, leading to limited food and water availability for
both crops and animals. Increased fire risk is another consequence of
drought conditions. Challenges related to water quality and availability
also arise during droughts. Moreover, droughts directly impact human
physical health by reducing water availability and compromising water
quality.</p>
<p>The Probability of Potential Evapotranspiration Deficit (PED) serves
as a commonly used indicator for assessing drought conditions. It
quantifies the difference between the potential water loss from the soil
through evapotranspiration and the actual available water. Measured in
millimetres, PED represents the rainfall shortfall necessary to maintain
pastures at their optimal growth levels. In this research, the drought
indicator is presented as the probability of PED exceeding 200 mm and is
categorised into 10% and 20% width bins in the maps (and location
insights) and the table, respectively.</p>
<h4 style="color:#007c9d;">
<img src="img/sea_rise.svg" style="margin-right:10px;" alt="Sea Level Rise"/>
Sea Level Rise
</h4>
<p>Sea level rise poses a significant concern for communities,
especially those residing in coastal areas. The physical consequences of
sea level rise include beach erosion, coastal inundation, and the loss
of marshes and wetlands. Coastal inundation refers to the flooding of
typically dry, low-lying coastal land. This inundation results in
various effects, such as the flooding of roads, walking paths, and
reserves, infrastructure damage, and the degradation of drinking water
due to saltwater intrusion. Moreover, it has profound implications for
the social, cultural, and spiritual wellbeing of communities, as it can
lead to the loss of land, cultural sites, and the displacement of
communities.</p>
<p>In our study, sea level rise information is expressed as a percentage
of the area likely to be inundated due to a 50 cm sea level rise.
Notably, this threshold value surpasses the mid-century RCP 4.5
estimation of 26 cm. We chose this higher value to address the
limitation that the available inundation maps do not account for
vertical land motion. This data is categorised into 2% width bins in all
the outputs.</p>
<h4 style="color:#007c9d;">
<img src="img/overall_climate.svg" style="margin-right:10px;" alt="Overall Climate Risk Index"/>
Overall Climate Risk Index
</h4>
<p>The overall climate risk index was created by combining all seven
climate hazards included in this study. For each SA2, we ranked its
exposure to various climate hazards and calculated the average rank for
each area. This combined score is scaled from 0 to 1, where a higher
number corresponds to a relatively higher exposure to climate hazards.
In the maps and location insights, the climate risk index is presented
in ten levels, each spanning a 0.1 width. The pivot table summarises the
overall climate information into five levels, with the same number of
SA2s in each level (quintiles).</p>

<div id="socio-economic-resilience" class="section level3">
<h3>Socio-economic Resilience</h3>
<p>Our overarching goal for this project was to evaluate the resilience
of Māori communities in the face of climate change. By understanding
their adaptive capacity, we aimed to pinpoint areas where targeted
support would be most impactful. Specifically, our focus centred on
community-level responses rather than individual ones.</p>
<p>The study population in this work consisted of all individuals who
lived in a Māori household during 2021. We adopted an inclusive
definition for Māori households, encompassing any household where at
least one occupant self-identified as Māori. This approach ensured that
individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds were part of our analysis. A
household, as defined for our study, included all people residing at the
same address during the reference year. We sourced this information from
the most recent address records available through the Statistics New
Zealand Administrative Population Census (APC) for the year 2021. Note
that SA2s with 30 or fewer Māori households were excluded from the
analysis.</p>
<p>Social indicators were extracted from data within the IDI, utilising
the most recent datasets available (as of 2022). Our approach involved
employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering analysis to
distil the extensive set of nearly 100 indicators into concise
summaries. These summary indices capture various facets of resilience,
encompassing dimensions such as poverty, health, justice and protection,
and the capacity to adapt to climate change. The latter was derived from
measures that were not already included in other indices but might be
associated with adaptation issues. For instance, these measures
encompassed having vulnerable members in the household (such as older
individuals), not being enrolled in education or training, unemployment
(which could lead to social isolation), lacking the highest
qualification (a proxy for literacy issues), and having no access to
telecommunication services. The health and justice indices were divided
into adult and child-related versions due to the strong age-dependence
of the underlying social indicators. Households without children or
youth were assigned a value of zero for child-related indices, as the
risk was considered negligible.</p>
<p>All the socio-economic indicators are categorised into ten groups,
each containing the same number of SA2s (deciles 1 to 10). A higher
decile number corresponds to a greater risk level. In the the pivot
table, these decile categories are combined to form five levels. In
addition, we have created an overall socio-economic risk index by
aggregating the six domain-related indices. For each SA2, a combined
score was obtained by averaging its percentage rank based on each of the
six indicators. Additionally, a weighting factor of 0.5 was assigned to
each variable that measured adult and child indices separately. The
resulting score is then scaled into a range of 0 to 1, where a higher
number indicates an area facing relatively greater risk due to
socio-economic factors. On the maps and location insights, the overall
socio-economic risk index is depicted across ten levels, each covering a
0.1 width. Meanwhile, the pivot table presents this information in five
levels, each containing an equal number of SA2s.</p>

construct the resilience indicators.</p>
