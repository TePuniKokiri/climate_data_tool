The results are based in part on tax data supplied by Inland Revenue to Stats NZ
under the Tax Administration Act 1994 for statistical purposes. Any discussion
of data limitations or weaknesses is in the context of using the IDI for
statistical purposes, and is not related to the data's ability to support
Inland Revenue's core operational requirements.
